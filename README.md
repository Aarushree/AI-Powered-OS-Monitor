AI-Powered OS Monitor

📌 Project Overview The AI-Powered OS Monitor is a smart system tracking tool designed to monitor system performance in real time. With AI-driven anomaly detection, it keeps an eye on CPU usage, memory load, and disk activity, spotting unusual patterns before they cause trouble. The system provides insights and suggestions to help optimize performance, ensuring smooth operation.

✨ Key Features: ✅ Live system monitoring – Tracks CPU, memory, and disk usage in real time.

✅ AI-powered anomaly detection – Uses machine learning to predict performance issues.

✅ Interactive dashboard – Displays system health with alerts and insights.

✅ API support – Allows easy data retrieval and integration with other tools.

✅ Step 1: Train AI for Anomaly Detection

Goal: Improve accuracy in detecting unusual system behavior.

✔ Collect system performance data for training.

✔ Use Isolation Forest, LSTM, or Autoencoder for anomaly detection.

✔ Implement real-time alerts when anomalies are found.
